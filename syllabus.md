## Assignment, Quiz, & Exam Policy  
- **Assignments** must be submitted via Pilot Dropbox. Ensure you upload and click *Submit*; you should receive an email confirmation. Failure to receive confirmation means the assignment was not submitted.  
- No late work will be accepted without prior approval. Extension requests must be made in advance due to personal circumstances.  
- Computer issues, data loss, or insufficient upload time are not valid excuses for late submissions.  
- **Quizzes** will be completed online and may be taken outside of class.  
- **Exams** will be administered in person. Dates for both will be announced in advance.  
- Students needing adjustments must notify the instructor promptly.

## Learning Objectives  
Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:

1. Design and implement RESTful web services using Node.js and the Express framework to support data-driven web applications.

2. Apply layered or Model–View–Controller (MVC) architectural principles to develop modular, maintainable backend applications.

3. Design, implement, and integrate relational databases using an Object–Relational Mapping (ORM) framework, including schema definition, migrations, and relational data access.

4. Develop client-side single-page applications using React, including component-based design, state management, routing, and API integration.

5. Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms consistent with modern web security practices, including secure credential handling and protected resource access.

6. Integrate frontend and backend components into a cohesive full-stack system that satisfies functional and non-functional requirements.

7. Apply professional software engineering practices, including version control, modular code organization, documentation, and collaborative development workflows.

8. Deploy, document, and present a production-style web application, demonstrating the ability to prepare software for real-world use and communicate technical work effectively.

9. Evaluate security, performance, and maintainability tradeoffs in the design and implementation of web applications.
